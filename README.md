```
A command line tool used to automate the process of updating outdated Python modules / packages with options to update *all* 
modules indicated via pip, update only user-specified modules by including the module name in a plain text file either comma 
delimited or separated by newline carriage returns - each on its own line. The option to simply return a list of outdated
modules found on the local system without performing any type of updates is also available. The next section illustrates the 
command line usage for the PyMods function.
